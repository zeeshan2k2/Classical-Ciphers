<h1>Classical Ciphers iOS App</h1>

<p>This iOS application, developed using UIKit, allows users to explore and experiment with classical encryption techniques. The app currently supports popular ciphers, including Caesar, Vigenère, Polyalphabetic, and others. Users can enter text, encode it using the selected cipher, and decode messages back to their original form, offering an interactive way to learn about classical encryption methods.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Encode and decode text using classical ciphers.</li>
  <li>Support for Caesar Cipher with customizable shift values.</li>
  <li>Vigenère Cipher implementation with user-defined keys.</li>
  <li>Polyalphabetic Cipher for more complex encryption.</li>
  <li>Intuitive user interface designed with UIKit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started with the app, clone the repository and open the project in Xcode. Run the application on a simulator or a real device to explore the functionality of different ciphers. Ensure you have Xcode installed and are running macOS.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or want to add more ciphers, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.</p>
